                    The Health and Research Summer Internship Program (HRSIP) is designed for students interested in
                    healthcare, nursing, dentistry, mental health, nephrology, optometry, medicine and public health. It
                    offers students the opportunity to work at local hospitals and underserved communities under the
                    direction of licensed local health professionals.

                    The program is based in Tarkwa in the Western region of Ghana, a dynamic metropolitan area of over
                    two hundred thousand people, and the heartland of the largest mining enclave in the entire West
                    Africa. Students will be exposed to a unique healthcare system that challenges them to rethink
                    novice ways of addressing healthcare challenges in a third world country.

                    Medical and Nursing students will learn about how primary care physicians and nurses’ function under
                    limited resources while being exposed to rare infectious diseases and treatment modalities using
                    local resources. Students will shadow licensed healthcare professionals at the Apinto Government
                    Hospital, Tarkwa Municipal Hospital and Accra Medical Center through clinical rotations to help them
                    understand the vital role of sociocultural competence in healthcare delivery. Dental students are
                    assigned to a mobile unit to visit elementary, junior and senior high schools to educate students
                    and screen them for possible cavities or diseases.

                    Public health students assist medical professionals in undertaking screening services in underserved
                    communities. Students have once in a lifetime opportunity to join weekly public health radio
                    discussions on Dynamite FM (88.9) to share their experiences as well as educate the populace on
                    selected weekly topics.

                    There are multiple ongoing research projects for students to apply their quantitative and analytical
                    skills. Each student must commit to actively engage in research projects that could lead to journal
                    publications. We are currently trying to understand the prevalence of HIV, Sexual Abuse, Anemia
                    among pregnant women and malaria cases in each of the health facilities we work in. Students are
                    encouraged to explore other avenues for potential research and discuss with their preceptors.

                    Ghana is known as the gateway to Africa. Homes are small and stuffy, so people are always out and
                    about. Ghana is an exciting and popular place to spend some time on a volunteer project or
                    internship. Ghana is an intensely colorful land on the West coast of Africa. Once the British colony
                    known as the 'Gold Coast', it is renowned for the friendliness and warmth of its people. Ghana has
                    great beaches, wild savannahs, and dense rainforests. This English-speaking country provides
                    volunteers with a wonderful introduction to Africa; it is politically-stable, safe, affordable, and
                    rewarding to visit. You can explore historic slave forts, shop in bustling colorful markets, wander
                    through rainforests, or laze on the hundreds of miles of beaches. When you explore this magnificent
                    African country, you’ll discover lakes and wetlands, fascinating historical sites and a profound
                    heritage. Gorgeous beaches offer a paradise on earth, and you will find yourself expanding and
                    relaxing into the warmth of the African sun, the sweeping blue skies over the mountains and green
                    forest. Most importantly you will love the people you serve and gain an experience the classroom can
                    never offer. Ghana has made lot of strides in the healthcare sector but also faced with unique
                    challenges. The internship provides unique opportunity to learn and experience the Ghanaian culture,
                    arts, and healthcare system. Students are encouraged to bring resources that can assist and improve
                    their experience.

                    Interns are accommodated in student hostels where they will live with other interns and local staff.
                    While volunteering in Ghana, most volunteers will stay in our Home-based. This concept is a
                    permanent residence set up especially for international volunteers. There are several bedrooms at
                    our Home-based and volunteers will normally share a room with a same gender volunteer. There are
                    common rooms fully equipped with a television and Wi-Fi. We manage interns’ meal plans and
                    accommodations for the duration of your time in Ghana. Three meals a day (breakfast, lunch and
                    dinner) will be provided and will consist of local ingredients and feature traditional cuisine
                    choices for Ghana. Our meal program can accommodate vegetarian needs; however, we are not able to
                    provide for other dietary restrictions. Food and drinks outside of mealtimes are the interns’
                    responsibility. In most cases, there are restaurants and markets nearby the homes in which our
                    volunteers stay. The environment is very relaxed and social and a great place to unwind after a busy
                    day. The kitchen and bathrooms are shared, and there is running water and “western-style” toilets.
                    The neighborhood is very safe and clean. There are many amenities nearby like internet cafés,
                    grocery stores, restaurants and mass transit stop. We put safety and comfort first as we deliver
                    enriching and consistent experiences for our students. Our support is multi-faceted while in-country
                    and our staff is in contact with our interns on a regular basis either with face-to-face visits or
                    via phone/email. Key support comes from our country coordinator and in-country field staff. These
                    individuals are part of the Firm Health Ghana Foundation setup and its partners. They are committed
                    to ensuring your experience the best it can be. Interns also have access to our country
                    coordinator’s mobile number for emergencies. With longer assignments, our field staff visits
                    regularly (every 2-4 weeks) to ensure the experience is meeting your expectations. Sometimes an
                    assignment may be too far to visit physically, so staff members will touch-base via phone/email. You
                    are also welcome to stop in the offices at any time. You are never alone. Living is basic but the
                    large majority of the volunteer houses have electricity and running water. If you have special
                    eating needs, please let us know ahead of time so that we can make arrangements for you. However, we
                    need to stress the point that you should not expect to eat as you normally do at home. We will do
                    our best to see that you are well taken care of, but also as an intern, there is a need to be
                    flexible. Specific details regarding accommodations, food and contact details for our local
                    coordinator will be provided in personalized intern placement documentation prior to arrival.
