          <h2 class="mb-4">A visit to Acklica (Tuesday: 13th December 2022)</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            After having breakfast around 7:30 am, the team traveled to Aklica, a cocoa farming community about an
            hour's drive from Tarkwa. To access the community, the team navigated across the Bonsa River with a canoe
            before trekking through some cocoa farms to the chief’s palace to interact with the chief and his elders.
            The team discussed their mission with the chief through his linguist. After 10 minutes of interaction, the
            team thanked the chief on behalf of his community and proceeded to the only school in the community. The
            group walked for 45 minutes through cocoa farms before arriving at the school.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            At the school, the team joined a Parents Teachers Association (PTA) meeting that was being held. As
            customary, introductions were done on both sides, after which engagements were held with the parents and
            teachers in one of the classrooms. Following the engagements, the best cocoa farmers in the community were
            tasked to take the students through the primary processes involved in cocoa harvesting and seed preparation
            before exportation out of the community to be processed into chocolate both locally and internationally. The
            team had interesting interactions with the farmers, inquiring about their understanding of mental health and
            what they considered to be a mental health disorder, among other topics, to which the farmers gave very
            interesting answers.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The team was also taken through how to weigh sacks of dried cocoa beans. After the interactions, the team
            was treated to some fresh coconut water and fruits to quench their thirst after a long walk on a sunny day.
            The team was then rowed across the Bonsa River once more to join their waiting bus and headed straight to
            Fiaseman Senior High School (FIASEC) around 15:30 GMT to interact with the students on cyberbullying and how
            to maintain sanity in the era of social media.

            The team arrived at the school at 16:30, having lunch on the bus. By 16:45 GMT, they engaged with school
            teachers and over 500 students in the assembly hall. Dr. Ebony White introduced the session, and
            participating students discussed mental health, emphasizing the significance of maintaining well-being in
            the era of cyberbullying on social media. They shared personal experiences, instances of social media
            bullying, its impact, and coping mechanisms, highlighting the importance of family and friends' support. Dr.
            Darko concluded by discussing the availability of mental health services for high school students,
            encouraging both teachers and students to utilize them. The team then departed for dinner at the Ghana
            Manganese Company’s restaurant." (178 words)

          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            After breakfast at 7:30 am, the team, including nurses from the mental health unit of the Apinto Government
            Hospital, was divided into two groups to visit two radio stations for an hour's discussion on the complex
            interaction between biomedical and faith-based approaches to mental health in Ghana. The first group went to
            Dynamite FM, while the second went to Mining City FM, both popular stations in Tarkwa and its environs.
            Discussions were conducted in both Twi (a local language) and English to ensure maximum reach. The teams
            educated the public on the roles both approaches play in mental health, highlighting various mental health
            units and advocacy programs in the municipality. This interactive session concluded with a phone-in segment
            where listeners asked thought-provoking questions.

            After the radio segment, the team visited the homes of individuals and families with mental health
            disorders.

            After breakfast, the team left Tarkwa for Ankaful Psychiatric Hospital, arriving after a five-hour journey
            in the Central region of Ghana. The visit provided insight into managing patients with serious mental health
            disorders. Led by the hospital's internship coordinator, a psychiatric nurse, the session covered Ghana's
            mental health history, the impact of the Mental Health Act, and challenges in implementation, particularly
            in the south. Medications, drug supply challenges, and general management were discussed. The team toured
            wards to observe the hospital's setup, actively engaging with the coordinator and receiving informative

            awake, working on their final presentations with a bonfire, music, and the cool ocean breeze. Team members
            later retired to their respective tents for a well-deserved rest on their well-inflated air beds.

            After a relaxing night, the team awoke to a beautiful sunrise over the Atlantic Ocean from their tents.
            Breakfast was served at exactly 8:00 am. Team members took advantage of the tranquil atmosphere to enjoy the
            beach and prepare for the final presentations scheduled for 4 pm. The entire morning and early afternoon
            were left open for participants to relax and savor the oceanfront while preparing for their respective final
            presentations later in the day. At 2 pm, the team paid a cultural visit to Nzulenzu, a floating village near
            the beach. The visit required a 20-minute boat ride across the freshwater lake, providing an exhilarating
            experience as the boat glided across the wide, natural lake surrounded by bushes and forests.

            The team took a quick tour of the town, led by the tour guide, visiting places of interest in the village,
            including the only junior high school. The tour ended with a dance session in a floating bar.

            and this engaging learning session involved each pair sharing their experiences and how the program had

            The next morning, team members engaged in various activities, including beach walks, runs, relaxation, and
            even yoga against the rising sun. After breakfast, the team prepared and packed up for a seven-hour journey

            and exciting night. Following a restful seven-hour journey, the team arrived in Accra. Sylvester Akpah (PhD)
            led an interesting closing session where each team member, including participants and hosts, described what
            the experience meant to them and how their perspectives on mental health and life had been influenced by the

                in the municipality, discussing their symptoms, their understanding of their diagnosis, medications, and
                more.

                Since Tarkwa is a gold mining town, the team visited a small-scale mining company to understand the
                processes involved in mining gold and also to see gold in its pure form. Upon arrival at the mining
                site, a tour guide led the team around, enlightening them on mine exploration, mining types, safety
                procedures, and the processes involved in producing gold. The guide took the team to some of the
                stations, where participants could also see and feel gold in its raw form.

                After the tour of the mine site, the team paid a courtesy call on the medical superintendent of Apinto
                Government Hospital, as he wasn’t available on the scheduled date.

                foreign dishes such as Jollof and chicken were available, complemented by a selection of both local and
                foreign wines. The team enjoyed good music, food, conversations, and card games for a delightful
                evening. Expressing gratitude to the generous hosts for their warm reception, the team then proceeded to
                Shooters Pub and Grill for karaoke and socialization, which included singing and dancing.
